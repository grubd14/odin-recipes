    <p class="item-description">Momo is a popular Nepali dumpling filled with seasoned meat or vegetables. These bite-sized delights are often enjoyed with a tangy tomato-based dipping sauce and are a beloved street food and festive delicacy in Nepal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>Water (as needed)</li>
      <li>1 lb ground meat (chicken, pork, or beef) or mixed vegetables (finely chopped)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped scallions</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon each: ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add water, mixing until a soft, pliable dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until smooth. Cover and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>n a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat or vegetables, onion, scallions, cilantro, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball). Roll each ball into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.</li>
      <li>Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each circle. Fold the edges over the filling and pinch together to seal, creating a pleated design.</li>
      <li>Arrange the momos in a steamer, making sure they are not touching each other. Steam for about 10-12 minutes or until the dough is cooked and the filling is hot.</li>
      <li>Serve the momos hot with the dipping sauce on the side. Enjoy!</li>
